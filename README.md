# UIT-ALGO-BOOTCAMP
UIT ALGOBOOTCAMP, ICPC, Data Structures and Algorithms

## TOPICS (ALGORITHMS - DATA STRUCTURES)
* https://github.com/BedirT/ACM-ICPC-Preparation: This program has been developed to learn Algorithms for use in Competitive Prorgamming. In the program there is only direction to resources, we did not add much content apart from what already existed. We just collected good sources to learn in one place, so that one can follow up and learn. The course includes algorithms and a bit data structures. You need to follow the the curriculum week by week. 
    * See the sources to study
    * Get the logic and try to code it without looking other code
    * When you are stuck(you really should try first) or when you are done, look at the source code, and compare it with yours so that you can see what would be the best approach for that algorithm. You may not like others, or you may find some of them useful.
    * After you feel comforatable with the code, try to solve the questions.
    * When you are done with solving or are stuck(again ...) check other solutions and try to understand your mistake or to see if a better aproach exists.
* https://github.com/matthewsamuel95/ACM-ICPC-Algorithms: ACM-ICPC Algorithms is a collection of important algorithms and data structures used to solve questions in this worldwide olympiad. It aims to provide solutions in various languages as per ICPC 2018 WF

* https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming: A curated list of awesome Competitive Programming, Algorithm and Data Structure resources. Created with a view to connecting people to information, this list below contains a complete collection of all the fantastic resources I've collected over the course of my 11-year competitive programming career. I hope you'll find it useful :)
* https://github.com/jnikhilreddy/Competitive-programming-resources
* https://github.com/ADJA/algos: Collection of different algorithms, used for programming competitions like ACM ICPC. Algorithms are divided by topic. Most algorithms are runnable from the file as is. Every algorithm has a reference problem on which it was tested, and some notes about its time and space complexity.
* https://github.com/ledduy610/interactive-coding-challenges: 120+ continually updated, interactive, and test-driven coding challenges, with Anki flashcards. Challenges focus on algorithms and data structures found in coding interviews.
* https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training: Problem solving training for computer science students
* https://github.com/ippeb/ACM-ICPC: List of basic algorithms and data structures for algorithmic programming competitions (International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), ACM International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC), Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, etc.). In the past, this list has been quite useful for solving algorithmic programming challenges on online judges like the Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) and competitions. Most of this has been coded during high-school (2008-2010) while preparing for the IOI. Consider this a disclaimer about the coding style. I will try to improve the code whenever I have some free time. Bullet-points that are not highlighted below have not been added yet.
