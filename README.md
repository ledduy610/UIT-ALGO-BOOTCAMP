* https://github.com/BedirT/ACM-ICPC-Preparation: This program has been developed to learn Algorithms for use in Competitive Prorgamming. In the program there is only direction to resources, we did not add much content apart from what already existed. We just collected good sources to learn in one place, so that one can follow up and learn. The course includes algorithms and a bit data structures. You need to follow the the curriculum week by week. 
** See the sources to study
** Get the logic and try to code it without looking other code
** When you are stuck(you really should try first) or when you are done, look at the source code, and compare it with yours so that you can see what would be the best approach for that algorithm. You may not like others, or you may find some of them useful.
** After you feel comforatable with the code, try to solve the questions.
** When you are done with solving or are stuck(again ...) check other solutions and try to understand your mistake or to see if a better aproach exists.
